## Description

This project aims to develop a comprehensive e-learning platform tailored to connect students and educators in an interactive online environment. The application facilitates robust learning experiences by allowing educators to create and manage courses, upload diverse learning materials, and directly engage with students. Students can enroll in courses, actively participate through comments, rate course content, and utilize secure purchasing options for course enrollment.

## Relational Schema

## Project setup

Install node_modules
```bash
$ yarn install
```

Setup Postgres Database

```bash
# setup Postgres Database with Docker (and your own Database Management Tool, for example: TablePlus)
$ docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ yarn install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
